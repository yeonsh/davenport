/**
 * A class can implement the <code>ErrorHandler</code> interface when it
 * wishes to handle errors thrown by the method handler for the current
 * request.  The Davenport servlet installs error handlers in a chain.
 * The first installed handler is invoked and given the chance to handle
 * the error/exception; if it rethrows the exception, the next installed
 * handler is invoked.  If unhandled, the error is thrown from the servlet
 * and handled by the container.
 * To install a handler,
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a class implementing the <code>ErrorHandler</code>
 * interface.  The implementing class must also provide a no-arg
 * constructor.</li>
 * <li>Add your handler's class name to the <code>errorHandlers</code>
 * parameter in the Davenport deployment descriptor.  Entries are
 * separated by whitespace; the handlers are invoked in the order in which
 * they are declared in the descriptor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * As an example, if you have a class <code>com.foo.MyErrorHandler</code>
 * implementing <code>smbdav.ErrorHandler</code>, you would add the following
 * to the Davenport deployment descriptor:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * &lt;init-param&gt;
 *     &lt;param-name&gt;errorHandlers&lt;/param-name&gt;
 *     &lt;param-value&gt;com.foo.MyErrorHandler&lt;/param-value&gt;
 * &lt;/init-param&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If no handlers are specified, Davenport installs instances of
 * <code>smbdav.DefaultAuthErrorHandler</code> and
 * <code>smbdav.DefaultIOErrorHandler</code>.  If installing your own
 * handler, it may be desirable to include these as "fallback" handlers:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * &lt;init-param&gt;
 *     &lt;param-name&gt;errorHandlers&lt;/param-name&gt;
 *     &lt;param-value&gt;com.foo.MyErrorHandler
 *                  smbdav.DefaultAuthErrorHandler
 *                  smbdav.DefaultIOErrorHandler&lt;/param-value&gt;
 * &lt;/init-param&gt;
 * </pre>
