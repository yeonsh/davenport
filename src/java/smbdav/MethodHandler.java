/**
 * A class can implement the <code>MethodHandler</code> interface when it
 * wishes to service requests via a particular HTTP method.  The
 * Davenport servlet registers a method handler for a particular method,
 * and dispatches requests to that handler.
 * To install a handler,
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a class implementing the <code>MethodHandler</code>
 * interface.  The implementing class must also provide a no-arg
 * constructor.</li>
 * <li>Add a servlet initialization parameter of the form
 * <i>handler.<method></i> to the Davenport deployment descriptor.  The
 * value should be the name of the class implementing
 * <code>MethodHandler</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * As an example, if you have a class <code>com.foo.MyGetHandler</code>
 * designed to service HTTP GET requests, you would add the following to the
 * Davenport deployment descriptor:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * &lt;init-param&gt;
 *     &lt;param-name&gt;handler.GET&lt;/param-name&gt;
 *     &lt;param-value&gt;com.foo.MyGetHandler&lt;/param-value&gt;
 * &lt;/init-param&gt;
 * </pre>
